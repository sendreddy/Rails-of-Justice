# Opensource Maintenance and Communication Processes 

Here’s a set of guidelines and processes that are implemented for this project to effectively maintain communication, organize issues and bugs, and manage contributions: 

## Guidelines and Processes for an Opensource Project
### Communication 
1. Community Discussion Platforms:
    - Use platforms like GitHub Discussions for integrating with the codebase 
    - Set up chats in Slack for real-time communication
    - Organize and schedule regular community calls or webinars using Zoom to discuss the project’s progress and engage the community
    - Use mailing lists for discussion, announcements, and decision-making processes 

2. Organize Issues and Bugs
    - Employ GitHub Issues for tracking bugs and issues
    - Establish clear naming conventions and labels for categorizing issues (e.g., “bug”, “feature request”, “help wanted”). 
    - Implement templates for new issue submissions to ensure all necessary information is provided  

3. Discussing Future Plans 
    - Publish a roadmap on the project’s repository and update it periodically
    - Use Milestones in GitHub to plan and track progress toward major goals 
    - Host meetings open to the community where plans can be discussed when needed. 

### Contribution process 
1. Contribution workflow 
    - Implement a fork-and-pull request workflow, where contributors fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request for review
    - Contributors must sync their fork with the main project regularly to minimize merge conflicts 

2. Code Review Process
    - All pull requests must be reviewed by the maintainer and by some other contributor of the project before merging 
    - Contributors must engage in code reviews by one or more contributors to increase code quality and knowledge sharing 

3. Testing 
    - New code submissions must undergo testing as applicable. A test case design would aid in this process  

4. Documentation
    - Updated documentation must be provided with every significant code change 
    - The updated documentation must be included in the repository and any documents such as UML diagrams must be uploaded there 
    - Comments in the code should explain the newly added functionality 
    - When new code is added to the existing files, documentation must indicate that 

### Code acceptance guidelines:
1. Acceptance criteria
   - Ensure that the proposed changes align with the current project’s goals and architecture
   - New features and bug fixes must not decrease the overall functionality
   - The code must follow the documentation process, style guidelines, must be secure, modular, reliable, efficient, extensible, and organized. The code must employ  modularity and encapsulation to facilitate information hiding and reuse. 
   - The algorithms implemented must be efficient 
   - Appropriate data structures must be used for the problem 
   - GitHub must be used to keep track of code 

2. Release management
   - A release schedule will be defined for regular releases or feature-based releases
   - The maintainer of the project will be responsible for merging pull requests into release branches and tagging releases
